# Football Fixtures

A collection of future fixtures for the sport of football (or soccer if you 
prefer).


## Introduction
This repository aims to bring together an open-source of fan-updated football 
fixtures. The goal is to collect all future fixtures from national league level 
to international competitions and all the way up to the World Cup.


## Editorial Policy
All files are in the simplest form of csv files. This means that they are ONLY 
comma separated without enclosing quotation marks around the data. For example:

    date,league,teams,time,note_1
    2022-06-24,AFC Cup,Kaya FC v Visakha FC,10:00:00,Group Stage
    2022-10-09,Ligue 1,Reims v Paris Saint-Germain,,
    2022-08-20,Premier League,Manchester United v Liverpool,15:00:00,Round 2

* The files are future-looking, so fixtures that have passed will be cleared 
out regularly.
* As long as a date is set, the fixture can be added; time of event can be 
updated later.


### Inclusion Rules
* The fixtures for men and women will be maintained in separate files.
* All national league / national competition fixtures are permitted.
* All international league / international competition fixtures are permitted.
